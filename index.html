                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America. It is the largest living rodent in the world. It's close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the coypu. 
                </p>
                <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <p>  
                The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests and lives near bodies of water. They can be found in:
                    <ol id="places">
                        <li>Panama</li>
                        <li>Columbia</li>
                        <li>Venezuela</li>
                        <li>Guyana</li>
                        <li>Peru</li>
                        <li>Brazil</li>
                        <li>Paraguay</li>
                        <li>Northeast Argentina</li>
                        <li>Uruguay</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually lives in groups of 10â€“20 individuals. The capybara is not a threatened species, but it is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.
                </p>
                <h2>Appearance</h2>
                <p>
                    The capybara has:
                    <ul>
                        <li>a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head</li>
                        <li>reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath</li>
                        <li>slightly webbed feet</li>
                        <li>vestigial tails</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents. The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over hair. Females are slightly heavier than males. Their hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet. Their muzzles are blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads.
                </p>
                <h2>Diet</h2>
                <p>
                    Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants, as well as fruit and tree bark. They are very selective feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side. Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle.
